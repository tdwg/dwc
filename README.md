# Darwin Core

Darwin Core is a standard maintained by the [Darwin Core Maintenance Interest Group](https://www.tdwg.org/standards/dwc/#maintenance%20group). It includes a glossary of terms (in other contexts these might be called properties, elements, fields, columns, attributes, or concepts) intended to **facilitate the sharing of information about biological diversity** by providing identifiers, labels, and definitions. Darwin Core is primarily based on taxa, their occurrence in nature as documented by observations, specimens, samples, and related information.

## Getting started

[Darwin Core Quick Reference Guide](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/)

Documents:

- [List of terms document](https://dwc.tdwg.org/list/): Comprehensive metadata for current and obsolete terms in human readable form

- [Distribution documents](dist/): Simple CSV files to start using Darwin Core
- [Website documents](docs/): Markdown files that form the source for the [Darwin Core website](https://dwc.tdwg.org/)

Community:

- [How to contribute](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md): a guide on how to contribute to Darwin Core

## Website translation

The Darwin Core website is available in multiple languages, see the "文A" menu.  Translations are managed within [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/darwin-core), if you wish to contribute please go to the [Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/darwin-core) and request to join, then email the Darwin Core Maintenance Group.

Translations of term data (labels, definitions, examples, comments) are retrieved from the [rs.tdwg.org repository](https://github.com/tdwg/rs.tdwg.org), see [rs.tdwg.org/TRANSLATIONS.md](https://github.com/tdwg/rs.tdwg.org/blob/master/TRANSLATIONS.md) for details on that process.

Translations of the rest of the Darwin Core website (guides, prose sections, navigation menu etc) is managed here.  [crowdin.yml](crowdin.yml) configures files required for translation, and as content is translated Crowdin will create pull requests.  The only manual edits required are for building a new language (configured at the top of [build/build-termlist.py](build/build-termlist.py) and, once the translation is ready, adding it to the end of the [navigation menu](docs/_data/navigation.json).

GitHub Actions are configured to rebuild the website automatically as translations are created/updated.

Note that **edits to translations should only be made in Crowdin** to avoid conflicts.
