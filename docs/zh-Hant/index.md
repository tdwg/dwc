# Darwin Core

{:.lead}
Darwin Core is a standard maintained by the [Darwin Core Maintenance Group](https://www.tdwg.org/standards/dwc/#maintenance-group). It includes a glossary of terms (in other contexts these might be called properties, elements, fields, columns, attributes, or concepts) intended to **facilitate the sharing of information about biological diversity** by providing identifiers, labels, and definitions. Darwin Core is primarily based on taxa, their occurrence in nature as documented by observations, specimens, samples, and related information.
