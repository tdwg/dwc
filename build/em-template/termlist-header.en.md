The Establishment Means Controlled Vocabulary provides terms that should be used as values for `dwc:establishmentMeans` and `dwciri:establishmentMeans`.

## 1 Introduction

This document includes terms intended to be used as a controlled value for Darwin Core terms with local name `establishmentMeans`. For details and rationale, see Groom et al. 2019. Improving Darwin Core for research and management of alien species. <https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.3.38084>

### 1.1 Status of the content of this document

In Section 4, the values of the `Term IRI`, `Definition`, and `Controlled value` are normative. The value of `Usage` (if it exists for a given term) is normative.  The values of `Term Name` are non-normative, although one can expect that the namespace abbreviation prefix is one commonly used for the term namespace.  `Label` and the values of all other properties (such as `Notes`) are non-normative.

### 1.2 RFC 2119 key words
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

## 2 Use of Terms

Due to the requirements of [Section 1.4.3 of the Darwin Core RDF Guide](https://dwc.tdwg.org/rdf/#143-use-of-darwin-core-terms-in-rdf-normative), term IRIs MUST be used as values of `dwciri:establishmentMeans`. Controlled value strings MUST be used as values of `dwc:establishmentMeans`.
